# Diffusion Toolkit

Diffusion Toolkit is an image metadata-indexer and viewer for AI-generated images.  It scans your 50,000 image collection in seconds and lets you search them by prompt, seed, hash and more.

You can also tag your images as favorites, rate them 1-10, sort them by aesthetic score, mark them as NSFW, blur images marked as NSFW, and auto-tag NSFW images by looking at keywords in the prompt.

Of course it lets you view the metadata stored with your image
